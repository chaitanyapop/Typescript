Typescript doc-

The reason to use the typescript is, it gives the type safety to the javascript code nothing else.
Typescript is basically a developement tool nothing more than that. The code which we have wtitten inside the typescript that eventually
get transpiled into a javascript code because the TS code browser does not understand. It is a wrapper around the JS so that while writing
a code we can see the probable errors there only.
